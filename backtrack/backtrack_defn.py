Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems 
recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, 
one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to
 satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of 
 time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any 
 level of the search tree).
